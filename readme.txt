A toy example using pyplot to plot a fractal:
  1. Begin with a vertical line
  2. At each endpoint grow a centered horizontal line of the same length
  3. If two parallel lines meet they do not grow
  
This fractal, the "I-tree" fractal, is similar to the H tree fractal, but
grows at a slightly different rate.

fractal.py can generate an image with NUMIT lines
fractal_anim.py generates an animation
